<h3>How	to obtain and install the software?</h3>

<p>To obtain and install the software, you just need to install docker desktop which already includes the docker and the docker desktop in it. This is for local development and is the only piece of software necessary. We will also use Heroku to host our website and develop a CI/CD pipeline that will automatically deploy our software to the Heroku web server for each release. For a new developer to be able to do releases you will need access to the Heroku server and an installation of git. The application can be deployed using these instructions https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git/.
</p>
<h3>How to run?</h3>

<p>Before you run the software, you have to make sure that you have docker installed on your computer. Once you have that, you can just pull all the changes code from the github repository and then run the “make build” command in the terminal. Finally, you can run “make dev” after. </p>
